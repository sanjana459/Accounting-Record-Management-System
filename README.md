# Accounting-Record-Management-System

Accounting Record Management System is a sophisticated transaction maintenance system designed to efficiently record, manage, and retrieve financial transactions using a hashing file structure. This project demonstrates creating a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter and implementing a robust data storage mechanism using a hashing approach.

This project simulation the ability to develop a functional and user-friendly Accounting Record Management System. By incorporating a hashing file structure, we can  demonstrate a solid understanding of data storage optimization and efficient retrieval. The utilization of Tkinter for the graphical interface helps in creating intuitive user experiences.
